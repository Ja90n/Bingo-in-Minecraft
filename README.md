# Bingo-in-Minecraft
This plugin adds bingo to Minecraft
To be clear, this is NOT Minecraft bingo, this is bingo in Minecraft!

A fun game to add to your smp to have a fun bingo night together.

All players can join the game by executing /bingo and than pressing the join button. You will see the main menu by doing /bingo

The main menu:

From here you can see the status of the game, you can join or leave if the game is inactive and see your bingo card if the game is active or go to the host menu.
